# Ember-data-relationship-tracker

Track ember data relationships to know if records are dirty.

## Problem

`isDirty` works great on ember data records if any of the attributes have changed. But it doesn't track relationship changes at all. This is because relationships are very complex and it's very hard to know if they are actually dirty or if they've just changed to reflect server state, e.g. because a new related record has been loaded.

## Solution

`ember-data-relationship-tracker` allows you to explicitly mark pieces of code where you might change relationships. This gives you a `hasDirtyFields` property on your models that lets you know if any attributes _or relationships_ have changed so you can reflect this in your UI.

In order to safely distinguish new versions from the server vs new edits in the client, you must provide a `relationshipTrackerVersion` field on your model. It can be a computed property or a real field, but it must be a unique value that changes whenever the server provides a new version.

## Example

```js
// ../models/post.js
export default class PostModel extends Model {
  @hasMany('comment') comments;
  @attr('version') version;

  // Add alias for relationship tracker 
  @alias('version') relationshipTrackerVersion;
}

// watch a section of code that might change relationships
post.watchRelationship('comments', () => {
  post.set('comments', someComments);
});

post.get('hasDirtyFields'); // true if comments has changed (or any other attribute has changed)

// rollback relationships to previous state
post.rollbackRelationships();
```
Works for `belongsTo` and `hasMany` relationships, and also knows if you set the relationships back to the original state and sets the property to false again.
